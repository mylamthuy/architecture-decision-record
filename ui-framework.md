## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our food delivery service app requires a framework that offers various pre-built components with customization options to maintain UI consistency and deliver a seamless user experience.

## Decision
After thorough consideration, we have decided to use React Native as the UI framework for this app.

## Consequences
- Allows for the use of a single codebase for both iOS and Android, leading to a reduction in time and effort.
- Provides users with a native-like experience by creating UI components with native elements.
- React Native relies on third-party libraries, necessitating continuous tracking of future updates.
