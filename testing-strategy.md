## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our team emphasizes the critical importance of ensuring the quality and reliability of the app through comprehensive testing

## Decision
1. Unit Test: A unit test is a software testing technique where individual units or components are tested to ensure they perform as expected.
2. Integration Test: Integration testing is performed after unit testing. It verifies that combined software components and modules work as expected when integrated together.
3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing: E2E testing simulates actual user behaviors using functions in the app. It validates the entire flow of the application from start to finish, ensuring that it behaves as expected from the user's perspective.

## Consequences
- The combination of these testing methodologies aims to ensure the app's functionality, overall quality improvement, and reliability.
- It enables the early detection of errors and bugs for prompt resolution, reducing the risk of critical issues and ensuring the app's release schedule.
- This approach improves the user experience by detecting and fixing issues related to usability and app performance before they reach end users.
