## Status
Proposed

## Context
The app requires a data storage solution that stores various data types such as order history, restaurant information, and customer reviews and ratings

## Decision
After careful consideration, we have decided to choose MongoDB as the database storage solution for the app.

## Consequences
- MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is flexible in managing large volumes of data with diverse data types.
- MongoDB allows data to be stored in a JSON-like format compared to traditional relational databases, providing an effective way to store and retrieve data.
- Developers may encounter difficulties in data modeling, as it requires careful design for effective data structures and maintaining data consistency throughout the app.
