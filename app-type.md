# App type - Hybrid App

* Decisiders : Thuy My Lam, Sanghyeon Lee

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are tasked with creating an application for our client that allows users to order food for delivery or pickup. The app must provide a seamless user experience, offer recommendations for nearby restaurants, provide real-time order updates, integrate with payment gateways, and include a notification system.

## Decision
After researching and discussing with the team, we have concluded to choose a hybrid app.

## Consequences
- The hybrid app (using the React Native framework) provides cross-platform functionality, eliminating the need for our team to create separate codes for Android and iOS.
- Our team members are familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, reducing the likelihood of encountering technical problems.
- Users may experience stuttering while navigating between pages when using the web due to internet speed limitations.
